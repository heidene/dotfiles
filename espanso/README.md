# My Espanso Config

[Espanso](https://espanso.org) is an opensource text expander that works on multiple platforms and lets you set up custom text shortcuts for snippets of text, commands, and forms that can be based on complex triggers.

This folder holds my personal configuration and matches (the actual text replacement snippets) for Espanso. Maybe it will be useful to someone else!
